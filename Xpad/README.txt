This app is based on python3 and PyQt5
	make sure you have them first. if you don't you can install them or 
	search it from the web to get some help

you can change the background color of this pad via change the setColor.txt file 

and similarly change the Geometry of it by edit the setGeometry.txt text file

once your mouse move in and out of the pad the text in the pad will auto-save to the 

XpadText.txt.

once you open the pad, the one will start from your last change.


###
	to use it just make this python script runable and start once the machine powers on, hope you will enjoy.
